          Hello there and welcome to my page! I appreciate you stopping by for a visit. My name is Jessica Gibbs and I currently work  for a non-profit agency
          where are focus is early literacy for children ages birth to 5. I have amazing coworkers and I enjoy serving the community. This new journey I have 
          begun with attending this bootcamp has definitely been an eye opener in a very small amount of time. I hope to attain knowledge here to further 
          my career in helping the community by learning how to build and maintain websites and databases that can help in collecting and sorting data of families 
          in the most needed areas. I also have some personal endeavors I would like to pursue and with the foundational tools I am learning in this class it should 
          be attainable. This is definitely a learning curve but I can only take it one day at a time and continue to put my best effort forward.
        </h3>
